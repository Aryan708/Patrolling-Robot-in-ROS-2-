# ðŸ¤– Patrolling Robot in ROS 2 + Gazebo

A ROS 2-based simulation project that enables a robot to patrol through a series of predefined waypoints in a 2D environment. The robot uses the Navigation2 stack (`nav2_simple_commander`) to autonomously move, avoid dynamic obstacles, return to the starting position, and log patrol history.

- Dynamic obstacle avoidance using Navigation2
- Return-to-start behavior
- Timestamped logging of visited waypoints
- Modular Python-based ROS 2 node
- Simulated in Gazebo (optional), or can be tested in headless mode
